# go-booking-cli

I built this command-line ticket booking application to teach myself the basics of the Go language. It was a hands-on project that taught me the essentials, from variables, data types, and loops to writing functions and using packages. I also learned how to handle user input, work with Go's common data structures like arrays, slices, and maps, and implement basic concurrency using goroutines and waitgroups.
